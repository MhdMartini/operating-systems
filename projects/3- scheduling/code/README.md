# SCHEDULING

Simulate four scheduling algorithms:

1. FCFS: First-come-first-served - Non-preemptive.
2. SJFL: Shortes-job first - Non-preemptive.
3. STCF: Sortest-time-to-completion first - Preemptive.
4. Round Robin: Quantum = 2 - Preemptive.
5. Priority: Highest priority first - Non-preemptive.

## Build

    make

## Run

    ./main <input file name> <output file name> <output interval>
